# Census Income Prediction Notebook

This notebook explores a census dataset to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year. It covers data visualization, cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning model preparation.

Key Steps Covered:

1 - Data Import and Exploration:

 * Loading the dataset using pandas.
 * Examining initial data structure and summary statistics.
 * Checking for missing values.
 * Visualizing various data distributions using seaborn and Plotly.

2 - Data Preprocessing:

 * Splitting data into features (predictors) and target variable (income level).
 * Handling categorical features using LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder.
 * Scaling numerical features using StandardScaler.

3 - Machine Learning Preparation:

 * (Remaining steps to be implemented)
 * Selecting and training a suitable machine learning model.
 * Evaluating model performance using cross-validation.
 * Tuning hyperparameters to optimize performance.
 * Interpreting model results and identifying important features.

TO RUN THIS NOTEBOOK:

1 - Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
 * pandas
 * numpy
 * seaborn
 * matplotlib
 * plotly
 * scikit-learn

2 - Download the required dataset: "census.csv"
3 - Place the dataset in the same directory as the notebook.
4 - Execute the notebook cells sequentially.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

 * The notebook is designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
 * For further details and explanations, refer to the comments within the notebook's code cells.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

 * Implement model training, evaluation, and interpretation steps.
